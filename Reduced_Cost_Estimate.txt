I have reduced db.m5.large RDS instance type to db.m3.medium instance.
I have also reduced EC2 instance to a shared instance. 
These changes would not considerably negatively impact the performance due to the content cahing.
They will also not impact overall system stability due to the distributed nature of the system.
